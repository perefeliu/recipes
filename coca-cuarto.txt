It is as simple as this:
Eggs
sugar
farine

your eggs must be separeted into the red part and the transparent part. with the tranparent part you have to mix them. The red part are to be mixed with the sugar and farine. finally, you mix everything and you put it inside the oven. as simple as that. 

The worst receipy ever.
